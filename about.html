                <p>My name is Remy and I am on way to become a full stack web developer. After graduating as Aeronautical engineer at University of Applied Science of Amsterdam I moved to Vancouver for new start in life. My purpose was to challenge myself emotionally, spiritually and mentally and best way is to go very far away and make it a new home. Vancouver was very far away from Holland, no family no friends only a new beginning. The first year I volunteered film industry and I worked aside as cashier. I had lots fun working on movies and learning how to be movie director. However I needed to move forward so I decided to study software development at BCIT. It was very intensive year, with no previous knowledge in software I had to learn C#, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, NodeJS,  SQL,  Swift.  It was really though but I managed . After graduating I need a break, so I packed my stuffed and traveled to Japan. It was one of the most amazing experience I ever had. </p>
